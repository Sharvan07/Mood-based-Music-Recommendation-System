A user's emotion or mood can be detected by his/her facial expressions. 
These expressions can be derived from the live feed via the system's camera.
A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various human emotions or moods.
Machine Learning provides various techniques through which human emotions can be detected. 
In our proposed system, a mood-based music player is created which performs real time mood detection and suggests songs as per detected mood. 
This becomes an additional feature to the traditional music player apps that come pre-installed in our mobile phones.
An important benefit of incorporating mood detection is customer satisfaction.
The objective of this system is to analyse the userâ€™s image, predict the expression of the user and suggest songs suitable to the detected mood
